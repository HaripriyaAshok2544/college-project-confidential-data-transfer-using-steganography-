# college-project-confidential-data-transfer-using-steganography-
My first ever main project did on python language. I did it as a college project and improved the previous versions of the steganography software by making our software accepting PNG files which have lossless compression and including two factor authentication using API provider"twilio".This project is not a perfect one since it may collapse if the execution order is not done correctly as well as other error causing issues. I'm working on the errors and hope to get an error free software within  few weeks. Also a big thing to mention in this is nothing but that we have't used any databases in this project. This project works entirely on Systems local disk memory and in order to show the communication between two people we have used two different usernames and passwords during login and used two different phone numbers to get verification OTp from twilio.
