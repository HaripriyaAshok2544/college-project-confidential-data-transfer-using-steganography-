# college-project-confidential-data-transfer-using-steganography-
My first ever main project did on python language. I did it as a college project and improved the previous versions of the steganography software by making our software accepting PNG files which have lossless compression and including two factor authentication using API provider"twilio".This project is not a perfect one since it may collapse if the execution order is not done correctly as well as other error causing issues. I'm working on the errors and hope to get an error free software within  few weeks.
