# college-project-confidential-data-transfer-using-steganography-
My first ever main project did on python language. I did it as a college project and improved the previous versions of the steganography software by making our software accepting PNG files which have lossless compression and including two factor authentication using API provider"twilio". Also a big thing to mention in this is that we have't used any databases in this project. This project works entirely on Systems local disk memory and in order to show the communication between two people we have used two different usernames and passwords during login and used two different phone numbers to get verification OTP from twilio.
